 <!-- Task 1
 Using everything youâ€™ve learned up until this point, write a script that asks a user
 about the width, height, and length of a box, then calculate and return to the user
 the volume of this box.

 As an example, a box with width = 20,
 height = 10, and length = 50 will have a
 volume of 10000 (omitting units, as they
 are not relevant in this scenario). For now,
 assume that the values provided by the
 user are valid numbers, but if you have any
 ideas on how, you can try to make this
 script in such a way that it will be resistant
 to invalid values. -->
