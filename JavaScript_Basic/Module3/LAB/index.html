Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

interacting with the user (dialog boxes â€“ alert, confirm, prompt)
Scenario
Let's go back to our contact list.
After some recent tweaks (i.e. using an array and objects) 
it is actually starting to look like a list. However, 
one quite serious problem remained. Changing data in the list,
 such as adding a new contact, 
 has to be provided for right away in the program code.
 
 What if we want to give the user the ability to enter the data of the added
  contact while the program is running? Modify the program to add, at the end
   of the list, not the contact, which is given in the code, but the one which
    the user will give during the program run. Use the prompt method to do this.
     At the end, display the first and the last contact from the list.
